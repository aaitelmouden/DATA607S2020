"that checks out  its florida"
"a contract very simplified is what when where and how much that is agreed between two partiesif they cannot fulfill their side of the agreement then your side cannot be enforced

they can probably ask for a retainer fee but if you refuse then the contract lapses"
"you can sue that and honestly i would even do you could be noble and let them keep your money if they didnt at least give you the option to freeze it f them and get your money back"
"what state i have 2 gym memberships one in miami and one in tennessee and both states  froze mine i think they legally have too"

"aaas business model"
"used to work for them they dont make money off the membership they make thier money off thier other services used to see how much they pay towing companies and boy is it more than what you pay for memebership"
"yep if you can afford the primer membership its a damn good deal for the ridiculous range of the tows included"

theyll give you gasi once parked on a hill in sf so steep that my gas gauge read empty didnt realize this until they filled me up enough to start my car and i drove away with 14 tank unlock your cari kept a spare house key hidden in my car so i never had to pay my landlords lockout fee tow you when you get a flatchanging a tire on the side of the road in 110 degree weather isnt worth it 1110 would recommend"
"lpt be sure to keep the battery charged some batteries dont like going totally flat"

but seriously im driving around the neighborhood at least once a week to keep it charged"
"my gym isnt charging during the pandemic that and theyre closed too"
"samesies"
"ditto"
"my gym was closed for two weeks and after that i got an email asking how to handle the payments they received there were a choice of deducting it from the next fee or to not claim it at all i thought about all the people that would probably get affected by this in the long run and opted to not ask for anything back now it opened again after those two weeks but theyre probably taking quite a hit economically and im just hoping they can keep all the employees im not going there but still paying since i also care about not being part of spreading corona if i can avoid it"
"you saw me a good person way to go you"
"thanks i think most of us try to contribute and help as much as we can different people different needs and opportunities and while i can afford this some unfortunately cant    
stay safe"
"ditto"
"mine closed and stopped charging then started sending out free home workout content to all members so im actually better off than if i hadnt signed up in the first place"
"i think what kills me is that on january 1st i started going to the gym in my building for the first time for three months me and my wife went everyday for like 40 minutes five times a week i was finally feeling better about my health and then bam stuck indoors"
"mood i feel this"
"yup exact same"
"you were going to the gym until the end of march"
"i dont remember exactly when our gym shut down here i think it was sometime in march"
"its just that things were getting pretty serious a while before then  surprised is all"
"not here in canada at least not earlymid march"
"yeah i was the same just at the end of january finally got into a rutine and not feeling bah gym and then this shit happens trying to get out of being introvert and the universe went nope get the fuck back into the box"
"everyday five times a week 

that gave me a good chuckle"
"haha i knew when i wrote it that it was stupid but yeah i meant 5 days a week"
"same made some good progress after going back to the gym after like 5 years then this shit happens"
"yup paid for a whole year upfront too"
"this is me public transportation and the gym membership theyre both operational and open even though im not using them due to avoiding people at a time like this hopefully were keeping someone employed with that money and if so its worth it in the end for me"
"definitely agree there i live in a very small community see the gym owners in the village all the time kind of small i know they will probably put our memberships on hold for a few months but even if they dont im not that stressed about it they have done such an awesome job with it since they bought it open 24 hours new equipment lots of classes 

it more this was my kick in the ass to get my ass in shape and the covid strikes never fails haha"
"yeah i just got going a while back and was starting to enjoy it and then this but i guess this could be applied to lots of things these days but here in sweden we havent locked down everything instead asking people to use common sense my common sense says dont for a lot of things though    
stay safe"
"ha same finally found a gym i feel really comfortable in well its not going anywhere hopefully so i will just start going again when its safe i had to get swabbed today for covid as i have a sore throat and a cough so its at least 3 days of isolation for me till the test comes back neither dr i talked to thinks its it though no cases near us at all but better safe than sorry still common sense doesnt seem so common these days so i will hibernate as long as i can hello from bc canada stay safe over there"
"good luck im in victoria hope you are well"
"hello fellow islander thank you stay safe out there"
"hope its not covid or atleast that it wont give you or others close to you a difficult time wish you all the best and a quick recovery   
i also find that the common sense becomes less common as time pass i guess its our best survival talent adaptation thats not beneficial right now"
"thank you that means a lot im more worried for my community right now so all available appendages crossed its just an annoying spring cold"
"same"
"paid the year up front for both my gyms one was like were closed until further notice no refunds sucks to suck the other sends biweekly emails on updates to the potential reopening as well as equipment being upgraded and stated that for every week of closure i can choose between receiving personal training sessions guest passes or a prorated discount on my next renewal no points for guessing which ones getting canceled when this is all over"
"yeah no kidding its funny how this whole situation either brings out the good or the bad makes it real easy to know who to support in the long run stay safe out there"
"it was a bad year to decide im going to make new friends"
"my dating life"
"oof this hits too hard"
"same i broke up with my gf and my best friend is with her now so i was like okey i will try to make new friends and was literally in the process of organizing a meeting with a few when this happened"
"perfect year for streaming services though"
"unless you have like siriusxm only in your car"
"most siriusxm subscriptions come with the app now  i listen on my phone all day"
"i hate them got a new car that came with it and i didnt know until my free trial was almost up and they kept calling and emailing me to pay lol no thanks i got spotify"
"perfect year for grocery store and amazon profit"
"its really a bad year to do anything in general"
"except build a homegym"
"i had just gotten into such a great routine was getting up early and going to the gym 5 days a week for the last year or so i had been on and off and really inconsistent but i had finally worked out a schedule and stuck to it for a solid month in february i even started to look forward to the gym fuck you rona"
"more like its a bad year to be a gym can always work out at home"
"lets be honest here body weight exercises are not as good as the usual lifts and most people dont have the space  money to buy a home gym im happy with a couple dumbbells and cycling season for cardio though"
"i used to only do bodyweight workouts at home for years and liked it but struggled to progress then starting lifting at the gym and was doing great for 6 months now my gym is closed and going back to bodyweight sucks i do it but it feels like a chore where lifting used to be fun"
"have you figured out what made it better at the gym maybe you can modify things at home to better reflect that 

like if it was the comradeship of other people maybe you could do workouts with others over video if it was the motivational music see if you can find something similar online like spotify or pandora"
"i havent figured it out 

im not very social at the gym and i listen to the same music at home so i dont think its that 

i honestly just feel different after a workout like because im still a novice i was adding 5 lbs to all my lifts pretty consistently and starting to put up some relatively heavy stuff the rush is different for me with bodyweight stuff maybe i should set a lofty goal of doing a handstand pushup or something i can work towards i guess

if that doesnt work ill probably just conclude that i like a different type of workout and try to save for a power rack"
"goals can definitely make a difference 

hope you keep at it and find a way to persevere"
"thanks"
"good points though i will say my husband is getting a more vigorous workout doing jump rope and body weight exercises than he was getting at the gym only investment so far has been a pipe so he can do pullups"
"yup a lot of independent gyms are going to fucking die over this"
"i know a guy who just opened a gym a few weeks ago lol rented space bought equipment now hes asking on facebook for advice on how to get business loans no idea what hes thinking"
"smh not sure he was thinking to try opening a gym right now"
"some gyms will refund"
"all the gyms in my area have paused their memberships so if you had 5 months left when they closed youll have 5 months when they reopen"
"there are better years yes but my gym still takes the monthly paycheck and offers free months in return"
"honestly by midfebruary most of the resolutioners have quit going anyway"
"my gym charged me for april and when i emailed i got nothing after 3 weeks obviously they are closed i ended up calling and disputing the charges youfit was nice while it lasted but when this reopens i am finding a new gym to join they pissed me off so much since my friends who belong to other gyms got emails saying their memberships were on hold immediately when the lockdown went into effect and wont have their half of the month they lost in march held against them and will get a credit on their account i cant wait to hear from them saying they cant charge me for some strange reason"
"a great year for people to cheap out on their new years resolutions without looking bad"
" laughs in obesity"
"appreciate the roundness"
"and a business"
"i got a golf member ship for the first time bye bye 1200 bucks ffs"
"lol i almost bought a kickboxing membership with the so dodged a bullet in that one"
"many  financial and human"
"most people dont use it anyways"

"ive been going as often as other years"
"girlfriend we need to get a gym membership

"i was doing so good with going a few times a week too "
"got a year aquarium pass for our family very young son who loves it to our local one for christmasit got used twice  not sure if it will be used again"
"last aquarium i went to the year pass was almost as much as it was to take the family"
"no it was a great year to get one because you arent paying for it right now and when you go back you get a second chance at a new years resolution"
"my one week trial ended right before lockdown and i was going to get the membership until i decided to wait a day to sort some things out and then we got into lockdown great timing"
"got a membership when everyday for two weeks and then my city shut down but kn the plus side they arent charging us at the moment"
"my gym still charges monthly but theyll give us free months to balance"
"it was a even more bad time to get a gym"
"yeah and i had finally been able to afford it after wishing for years and had been going to as many classes as i could just to see what i liked for 2 and one half weeks beforebam"
"for me its the same result as any other year at least now i have an excuse"
"and my regal unlimited membership also paid for the whole year up front i havent received any communications from regal theaters regarding whether there will be some kind of give back but i wouldnt be surprised if there wasnt theaters are struggling so much and this was from before the coronavirus shutdowns "
"dunno mine expired march 15th feel pretty good about that choice"
"i suffer from depression and when i finally hit 1 month of pure back to back gym sessions this happens why must you forsaken me lord my gains are diminishing and my waistline threatens to return to its former glory"
"as compared to what every other year ive had a gym membership"
"planet fitness suspended all payments from customers  im thankful for that but i read that the ahutdown is gonna take a whole 10 out of their total savings"
"i got mine on march 14 on march 15 my country went into lockdown"
"i had bought mine a month prior to this happening and was going every damn day without fail really trying to make some personal changes on all levels and that was helping a lot

so much for that approach"
"it was a bad year to exist"
"i was going month by month since mid november and i finally hit the bullet and bought my year long membership march 1st once they shut down late march i still got my last 11 months refunded though"
"i lost 3 out of 6 swimming pool membership months due to coronavirus "
"and an eharmony account lol unless you count penpals"
"yeah yeah it fucking was"
"my husband and i signed up to the gym and then a week later it closed due to covid19  we got in 2 good workouts lol"
"i was planning on getting a membership the friday but didnt  cause of laziness the monday they closed the gyms im taking it as a sign"
"just committed to a membership in january as a birthday gift"
"the one time i was able to go the one time"
"lets be honest here it doesnt make a difference"
"mine paused payments"
"its always a bad year to get a gym membership tbh"
"i was going to join up just as the lockdown happened"
"any year is a bad year to do it"
"i dislocated my knee in january and couldnt go for a couple of months and when i finally did start going again it closed for lockdown after a week big waste"
"i use a local ymca and theyve offered to suspend your account have you pay half to support their overhead or pay the monthly as a donation im extremely fortunate to not be financially impacted by this and donating to support my local community is exactly where i want my money to go"
"o yes and i also have tennis club membership yoga and museum card well spend money 


"
"i got a kickboxing membership now i feel my fat growing by the second"
"i joined one at the start of february was going 45 times a week and was actually feeling better and starting to see little physical difference got the notice 315 they were shutting down so i got weights and stuff for the garage problem is thats where the beer and weed is too so my workouts seem get interrupted"
"gt was

is"
"lol how"
"no"
"you dont have problems with putting fresh manure in your garden ive always had a manure pile i turn so it wont burn the plants how far out from planting are yall"
"we have a massive garden space and we till deep so its diluted enough that its fine its also mixed with bedding material like straw and is from our over winter deep bedding so its been composting in the barn since november the warmth of the bedding composting actually works to keep our animals warmer we will be planting wednesday "
"what ratio fresh to winterized do you use"
"according to my fitbit a couple hours working in the garden burned more calories than what i typically burn in an hour in the gym"
"holy fuck its the next morning and my arms are screaming still more to do today someone pray to the homesteading gods for strength for me as i have a date with the fence post pounder "
"hard to say the deep bedding is about 6 deep and i would say the top inch or two i would call fresh and the remaining i would call overwintered"
"seconded whenever someone brings up the gym i just mention that i   insert homestead activity here ex tilled my garden turned the compost pile weeded my garden etc yesterday used a mattock to take out all my aggression on the burdock taking over my pasture in the rain for 2 hours  who needs pilates when you have a pickaxe"
"damn right who needs a gym membership when we live this life"
"plus not only did you burn calories but you get to look at what you have accomplished certainly some days are more satisfying than others but still"
"rbadasswomen"
"sweet i am new to reddit and didnt know that was a thing headed there now "
"being that gorgeous must be such a burden"
"haha thanks my ego had not been properly inflated yet today "
""
"its true  hes correct"
"lol you guys are far too easily impressed  but ill take the compliments all day long"
"i dont mind giving them"
"deleted"
"congrats you win the creep of the day award  enjoy"
"yeah but most dont want to motivate you to work out they just want to motivate you enough to get a membership"
"yeah they dont actually want you there  the best gym member is the one that paysautopsy never cancels and never once works out"
"yip like insurance"
"there is an app where you can bet against them for how much weight you will lose apparently the app developers are still making money when people are putting money against their own goals so it doesnt seem to motivate everyone enough"
"interesting there are some companies also that have started offering incentives around staying healthy"
"that is because the developer keeps a portion of all bets made it is a big rip off they keep like 20 so even if you win you dont get the payoff if you had made bets with people in real life the app takes a cut and then if others win the same as you then yall split the money you could end up losing money despite winning your bet"
"interesting i never really looked into it because having the added pressure of losing money while not meeting my goal sounded depressing only 4lbs from my goal weight now and havent lost a cent"
"thats actually a really good idea bot idk if a gym would accept to do that because they would lose money"
"no they wouldnt they would gain more business and people would still fail to lose weight like they always do"
"true you can count on the normal population distribution of any metric of human behavior"
"some gyms do this type of thing  i worked at a gym once that had a dollars for lbs fat off deal  for every lb you lost during this competition the gym paid you   you had to pay to enter but plenty of people made their money back  the gym ended up losing a bit of money on the deal but the advertising it earned them paid it back in spades"
"in the netherlands there is gym franchise called trainmore en you get 1 back for every time you visit the gym for at least 30 minutes though there are some exceptions im not sure if it motivates people but i believe the gym is rather succesful or at least it was until corona hit"
"the en told me youre definitely dutch but imo the government should subsidize gyms like this though it should be based on i not weight"
"not everyone goes to the gym to lose weight"
"would probably be cheaper to do this than pay for healthcare"
"no shit"
"make it so the treadmills keep the lights on"
"anytime fitness where i live requires that you sign an 18month contract to get the cheap membership price otherwise you pay twice as much to go monthtomonth yeahnot happening i bought my own equipment and worked out in my basement and now that the gym is closed from the pandemic i feel like a moneysaving genius"
"they bank on people buying memberships at the start of the year and never showing up free money"
"i have a small gym setup at home bench dumbbells spin bike chindip station but while it gets the job done i look forward to getting back to the gym  

its not that i socialize or talk to people or anything but sometimes i like being around people who are exercising when im working out and they also have some equipment for moves i cant emulate at home heavy deadlifts for example itll be nice getting back"
"it motivated me seeing positive energy"
"agreed"
"other important part is watching people do weird exercises and then googling to see why ive added some dope exercises that work better for correct muscle activation because i saw someone doing something weirddifferent"
"i think a hybrid of both free weights and bodyweight workouts are optimal this is just my personal preference though i am a member of a luxurious gym that has a lot of amenities i really enjoy so i intend to keep my membership although i do not pay for my membership so i am obviously in a unique situation"
"if i quit i would really miss the sauna"
"literally the reason why i havent quit the gym i look forward to is so much after my workout its an integral part"
"the sauna is always my post workout reward"
"lol me too its honestly the only reason i can motivate myself to go to the gym i just think about how good it feels to sit in there after and it drives me to go"
"exactly same here"
"bought an infrared sauna for the home through costco a while back and it was so worth it  its not quite the same as a regular dry sauna but it hits the spot"
"my training mostly involves bodybuilding with lots of heavy compound movements switching to a home gym with some adjustable dumbbells and just a bench has been a fun experience ive stuck with low rest periods myoreps bfr etc

now i dont think there are many good substitutes for certain movements like  bench press or squat but  im finding that this is really making me rethink my approach to training i normally spend about 810 hours physically in the gym each week for lifting now that i have some basic equipment once things go back to normal i may simply limit my time in the gym to compound lifts i cant do at home which would mean maybe being physically in the gym 23 hours a week and working out the rest of the time at home i think by sticking to a suboptimal training program for a lot of my accessory work i can get my exercise time down to 5 hours a week which would be amazing 

ampx200b

it may sound unusual to say i want to use a suboptimal program but im starting to realize that in my 30s i value my time a lot more than optimality and thats an important lesson im taking from this experience being at home due to covid"
"this is every gyms biggest nightmare"
"yeah i think gyms and hairdressers will see a reduction in the number of clients many of people have tried to cut their own hair at home and it has worked out nicely in addition people have less money available so saving the money that usually goes to the gym and hairdresser is a tempting option"
"i doubt they are cutting their own hair"
"i just dont like gyms bc of germs and i dont really care to be around people  so ive been adding to my garage gym over the past 3 years  its definitely the way to go  dont have to drive anywhere and the money i invested in the equipment gives me a little more motivation to get out there and use it"
"ditto all of this i maintain a small home gym in my unused second bedroom mostly unused if you count boxes from my last move i never unpacked its by far the best noncar money ive spent in the last few years i dont care for the whole process of going to the gym so this has been fantastic so much time and energy saved by having it at home"
"same as well i have a very small space but i have a rack and weights and its replaced the gym for me i know its not for everyone but it has enhanced my life so much just doing it at my home on my own schedule in my own space"
"i am fully convinced that i train more consistently bc of having home equipment"
"just bought my first house and i absolutely cannot wait to turn one of the bedrooms into a home gym gonna keep it simple at first just a rack bench and weights but im pumped to be able to workout at home"
"congrats on the house thats pretty much what i did started with the puzzle piece flooring a rack bench with preacher curl and leg developer bar  plates and a couple sets of dumbbells also picked up rings to hang on the rack for some extra fun last year i picked up dip bars and a wallmounted cable setup for space efficiency reasons and it was great apart from the assembly process

im a renter so i have no idea how this will all get broken down when the inevitable move happens but thats futuremes problem "
"i would love to do a home gym in my garage but it is not attached and doesnt have proper climate control 

it would be absolutely freezing in the winter and a deadly sauna in the summer 

stupid chicago weather"
"is that something that can be solved with a space heater and standalone ac my gym is in my second bedroom so heating isnt so much an issue but it gets gnarly hot in summer thanks to the location of my ac and the poor airflowdesign of my apartment can definitely relate thereeven though putting in a vertical fan helped my summer workouts are definitely sweaty and dehydrating"
"i just dont know if having something like that would make a difference i mean i could look into doing something proper but i dont think it would be worth that kind of money 

a space heater when it is 10f with no real insulation in the garage would probably not cut it 

and you know i dont need another reason not to go haha"
"haha yeah thats a great point im in new england but sometimes forget how much of a frozen hellscape chicago becomes in the winter while theres probably a heater out there for the job the cost  the cost of running it  insulating the floor etc would be a real investment im sure"
"not knocking it at all but you can insulate the garage for a couple hundred pretty easy and a decent space heater on a smart switch or two are cheap  window hvac is a hundred  

i say this having just done it   i didnt do it for a gym but to work on other shit  but its doable i just prefer the gym myself  just food for thought"
"i would definitely be interested in attempted it where do you live"
"dc  less winter but way hotter summer"
"gt anyone else having a similar experience 

not here i miss the shit out of it cant do pullups because the parks are closed besides that i have a few bands and a 15lb kettlebell im in a 400 sqft studio there is barely room to even do bodyweight stuff in here its also where i cook sleep shower eat and work at the moment i want my heavy weight back plus i enjoy the atmosphere and going to a place were the only focus is exerciselifting is part of the motivation for me its my church my little mental break from all the stress in my life 

that said there were days where i just didnt feel like dealing with the crowd so i am going to work on getting my own equipment essentials and possibly renting a storage unit to use as my alternatebackup gym"
"this  i mostly do functional fitness stuff usually a class 3  5 days and train myself on the alternates and i really miss it because it was my time out from the world 

ive always been fun training at home running doing nike training clubs or using a wod generator if i want to do a bit of crossfit style stuff but the gym is my control i go before work and its the time when i can say i didnt just wake up to work plus i just really enjoy the classes"
"its like a playground for adults plus you get to wear coolfunky clothes and shoes with space age materials and crazy colors that are generally not acceptable in other situations it makes you feel like a athleteninjasuperhero not to mention ive been going to the same gym 36x a week for like 4 years so i pretty much know everyone there"
"just before lockdown i bought a bench and some dumbbells  now they reside in my kitchen and every day after work i do 10 sets of something  already gaining"
"you can do quite a bit with a dumbbell and a jump rope in addition to a multitude of bodyweight movements that can be scaled to varying degrees of difficulty"
"same i am currently spending 200 a month for 3 x per week barrys bootcamp classes
prior to starting barrys i was a member of a 103 a month gym plus was doing extra gym classes elsewhere

i defs think when this is over i will be going running outside and investing in my own at home weights theyre sold out everywhere in the uk so relying in one kettlebell
and maybe just doing a once a week barrys as its amazing haha

fitness and health is very important to me i enjoy it alot and the classes are amazing but ive been really enjoying exercising outside so maybe for the summer at least ill keep it up"
"if your goal is strength youre going to need to handle some heavy weight with that said theres absolutely nothing wrong with bodyweight exercises just dont expect optimal strength and hypertrophy"
"i started dabbling in body weight fitness about 3 months ago and found it more enjoyable and sustainable than traditional weights this current situation hasnt really had an impact on my daily exercise"
"i love body weight stuff yoga hiit and once you get conditioned to regular body weight you can easily add in weights bit by bit and end up with a nice home gym "
"ive been working primarily in hiit and body weight for years mostly because i couldnt find a gym that fit my budget and schedule i finally found a gym that met both two weeks before the shut down

bodyweight and hiit is amazing especially for functional strength it should always be a component of your routine however gyms are also essential for strength building nothing will get you as strong and toned as challenging deadlifts and compound movements"
"body weight has been my best choice and im shredded im not affected by the lockdown im even helping people stay active with body weight"
"any time you do different exercises youre likely to work the muscles in ways they arent used to and inducing new kinds of soreness which is cool and a good thing to look at doing from a standpoint of keeping things fresh and interesting 

on that note i think thats also part of what has you excited to work out in general as humans we crave novelty to maintain our interest and excitement and workout routines are no different however i suspect that if you did your current hiitbodyweight stuff for a year straight youd start to feel stale with that as well

for me what the quarantine has made me rethink is simply the benefit of buying a power rack bench and free weights and getting my own home gym really up and running so i dont have to be dependent on an outside facility worry about germs waiting to use equipment etc"
"yep  ive been doing hiit workouts via the fiton app  a lot of the videos incorporate dumbbells of various weights  i enjoy these so much and i know that even when the gym opens back up i wont want to be out in public for long periods of time anyway  my membership is up in june i think  strongly considering cancelling my membership at this point"
"i pulled out the weight bench dumbbells and weight vest  coupling bw exercises with the vest and dbs has made me very happy  vests are definitely a big addition to home workouts"
"i agree ive been loving doing some of the live instagram workouts ive been doing the barrys canada workouts almost daily their trainers are amazing"
"once i get a rack and weights im definitely gonna cancel my membership yea i have less workout machines but save time and convenience at home"
"can i ask what hiit routine are you currently doing"
"i just went on youtube and did a quick search for a home hiit i tried a few but my favorite one so far is by a trainer named natacha oceane she does a really good job and mixing things up she also posts regularly so things dont get stale"
"i sort of miss the energy of the gym with people buzzing around and working out i also miss our group cycle class which helped keep me motivated an our instructor who had some great advice which would have helped me if with my upcoming rides  events 

being in another place let me forget about current issues and shift my frame of mind its much harder to do that

on the bright side i dont have an excuse not to work out at least 30 mins to an hour everyday i only have 3 kettlebells and a smart cycle trainer so i have to be creative but i still get a good workout in"
"its been that way long before this came along millions of people are gross look at the smaller scale of when you went to the gym you would see one or two people not wiping down the machine before or after magnify that now"
"single leg body weight squat is killing me"
"im too scared to even try"
"im not a fan of gyms when i do go i just act like no one else is there anyways i never use any of the amenities because honestly the people i see using them are disgusting"
"i had a gym membership for pilates and to swim as im mostly a runner i never had the selfdiscipline to work out at home the boyfriend and i are building a home gym in our workshop which should cover the little bit of weightlifting i do and once this is all over and my boyfriend goes back to work i can possibly see if my neighbor wants to come over to work out with me so we can both stay accountable ill save swimming for the springsummerfall when my triathlete buddies are doing open water swims in the river and do indoor rock climbing in the winter

thats a long way of saying that yes im considering dropping the gym"
"fitness is the practice of adapting to the physical demands placed on the body the majority of people do very little to change up their routine and thus they experience diminishing returns after all if you routine is always about the same what is there for the body to adapt to what we are experiencing now as a global community is a forced change to our fitness routine so i am not surprised you are having good results however the science shows that you will adapt to your new routine between 4 and 12 weeks of starting it

so although there is plenty of variation that can be introduced even with a home workout i wouldnt cancel my gym membership when you go back to weights youll have an even more effective workout than before"
"really a good point one of the pros to keeping the membership would be access to good equipment and variety"
"ive been working out in my home consistently for about 10 years now during this time i have added to my equipment as my interests grew and i looked for new ways to motivate myself the best thing about what is happening now from a fitness standpoint is that people are discovering new ways of working out changing their routine suddenly things like resistance bands body weight training jump ropes etc are found to be very challenging and beneficial i hope people remember this when things get back to normal i wouldnt think of ever going to a gym and always looking for some new equipment good luck to all of you i would add that i am fortunate to have a basement to do this so no disrespect to anyone that does not or just prefers the gym environment just remember that variety really can hold your interest in those times when we all need that extra push dont let this time go to waste"
"are you talking diminishing returns if you dont progressively overload or confusing the muscles"
"yes you must progressively overload the challenge of the lift but not necessarily the pure weight for example for op benching at x weight may be harder than a pushup but where he was doing sets of 8 on the bench he is now doing sets of 25 pushups or you can imagine someone benching at 185 to switching to db bench press at 85lbs each the db bench may be more challenging even though it is less weight"
"ok agreed to be fair though you can still progressively overload bodyweight with the upper body for a hell of a lot longer than that you can weight them for one or just vary the leverage to stay in your desired rep range from pike pushups to handstand pushups pseudo planche to planche pushups incline to decline rows and to one hand pullups gymnastic rings are several years worth of progressive overload by themselves its just harder to measure and overload incrementally"
"oh 100 agreed you can stick with calisthenics and see progress over a lifetime to truly appreciate lifting you have to remember we are dealing with torque and you can increase the demand on the muscle by changing the weight or the distance from the fulcrum and im not sure to what extent the muscle know the difference you definitely dont need weights to get big"
"oh god same here"
"ive been working out at gyms for more than 40 years and i need my gym more than ever ive tried working out at home but i need the variety of equipment that a gym offers and the inspiration of a lot of different people doing a lot of different things i never get bored at the gym theres always some new piece of equipment or some interesting new way of doing something old"
"very limited space in my rented apartment so i do miss the gym have dumbells and pull up bar here but dont have the means for heavy squats or deadlifts and i miss them"
"not me i miss my gym so so much but i have an amazing gym very friendly people its huge not often too crowded kids love the child care and for the first time since high school i have a ton of people i love talking with at the gym cant wait to go back"
"yes ive been doing home workouts and even started doing yoga and i feel more productive now than my last 6 months at the gym ive even started running 

with all this free time i finally started chopping the tree in my backyard down im seriously thinking about canceling my useless money sucking gym membership"
"welcome to crossfit after this is all said and done find a solid box to join its a lot more fun"
"my motivation comes from being in the gym ive barely exercised in the last three weeks because its so boring to do it in my house"
"uflip17 are you able to share your workouts im looking to be motivated by something new and while i have kettlebells and an olympic bar and plates at home i am bored your line about awakening longlost muscles intrigued me"
"here you go this was the first one that rally challenged me
httpsyoutubecyd7f5bqj4"
"thanks so much uflip17 i browsed through the moves and it looks really exciting happy wednesday"
"no problem hope you enjoy it"
"not me  im dying to get back to a gym with weights"
"me tooi find it hard to be efficient and feel spent from my home workouts  i am enjoying the outdoors more though"
"my gym has childcare which is a must have for me right now with everyone home its not as big of a deal but when my husband goes back to the office ill need it"
"i think the new sores youre feeling is just because of the new workouts youre doing that is not hitting certain muscles or motion variances 

from my experience doing weightlifting then shifting to hiit my trusted trainer friend told me often times the hiit workout sequences are not ideal and it did not seem like he was much of an advocate for it with that said i think both workouts are effective and it really depends on what your goals are or what you prefer"
"between my home gym and calisthenics i doubt ill ever pay for a gym membership again ive got everything i need right here"
"the trainer at my local planet fitness doesnt think a lot of the planet fitnesses will survive this i hope hes wrong i was doing hiit type of workouts there now at home i have a battle rope trampoline and a lot of outside space to run or move around in im going to order a good set of resistance bands friday for my birthday i need one set of dumbbells or at the least a single dumbbell and ill be okay for a while but i miss the gym a lot"
"same here i spend nearly 400 a month on gyms but now i feel like i get more out of going to the park"
"i paused my gym membership for a month and started going out to the forest near my home and boy it was such a pleasant surprise i will still be going when all this is over that said i still prefer having free weights and machines instead of fooling around with resistance band and bodyweight exercises all the time another thing is when im home i tend to break by sitting at the computer"
"i dont go to a mainstream 24 hour type gym instead i go to a nearby local gym that a guy owns and trains people semi privately meaning he gives instructions and situates you and then goes onto another person to do the same back and forth and back and forth the local gym is not crowded relatively more sanitized and most importantly has someone who will trash my lazy ass and correct me whenever i take a unnecessarily break or use the equipment incorrectly i do miss that environment as i need more than just self motivation to carry on my workouts effectively"
"also lot more body weight based exercises skipping and lifting things at home even taken up cycling with my dog in a doggy backpack she loves it httpswwwinstagramcompblrhfvjuhvhttpswwwinstagramcompblrhfvjuhv"
"its never bad to shake things up in your workout  ive been considering gym closure as a bonsai challenge  ill just have to grow in a different direction"
"i have kettlebells reebok step and walking enough to achieve a basis level of fitness"
"i installed a home gym late last year im appreciating having a gym at home"
"im the same way im 30 now ever since i was in my mid teens ive been a guy who goes to lift 90120 mins in the gym since this quarantine ive bought kettlebells wallballs slam balls sandbags and a combat rope ive been doing 2030 min workouts and i feel like ive been getting such better workouts and better results and im really having a lot of fun 

definitely have to reconsider my membership when this is over"
"i dont think im going to cut out the gym but being forced to work out at home has made me realize how much i can do here i purchased a subscription for online classes and ive been really enjoying it as you said i was also surprised how challenging they were its already measurably had an impact on me and i was already going to the gym regularly 34 times a week before the current situation

i do miss some group classes at the gym and the availability of some equipment like bikes treadmills etc but given how much i can do for my fitness without spending very much money im inclined to spend less on the gym moving forward

i am fortunate to have a small house which gives me some space to work out in peace if i lived in an apartment it would likely be more difficult"
"body weight fitness just exposed a lot of weak points that i ignored with weights dont mind starting again with high rep ranges"
"this quarantine has made me realize how much i need the gym  i have almost no room to do a workout i am still too obese to do a lot of the body weight workouts comfortably and i have very little weights

i am going to give the squat rack a giant hug when my gym opens back up  and then wipe that spot down with cleaner"
"ive had a home gym for going on 3 years and i dont ever see myself going back to a commercial gym  its allowed me to be very consistent and its nice to lift how i want without worrying about other giant sets etc  i also started adding in hiit finishers about a year ago and its made a world of difference i picked up a weighted vest right before the virus really hit and i absolutely love it i highly recommend it for spicing up the bodyweight circuits"
"what apps or techniques do you use ive been trying to find a good plan to follow"
"i just looked on youtube for an at home hiit workout i tried a few but the one that challenged me the most was posted by natacha oceane"
"thanks for the recommendation"
"both compliment each other if you hate the gym do what i did and invest in a power rack and buy cheap second hand plates online probably sold out or marked up atm but might sell cheap once demand goes back down with an overstock if those items i do both weights and sprinting for rugby as theyre both necessary skills try both even long distance cardio anything from 23km "
"im really liking my home routine which is a mix of bodyweight and traditional lifting couple dumbbells and an ez bar with around 150 pounds of plates and pull up bar im definitely making some progress here as im working out strictly every other day vs the splits and 3 day plans ive been doing so hitting everything more frequently than i was but i think im liking it more as a change from what ive been doing the past couple years really miss deadlifts"
"whats your routine been"
"im not  i hate bodyweight stuff  it sucks and its boring  i want a goddamn barbell in my hands  fuck"
"i feel the same way i dont even have a pull up bar ive a suspension system a bar that i set between two chairs to do australian pull ups the wall and the floor between doing push ups rows and using the suspension system to do assisted vertical pushes ive developed muscle and ive began to hypertrophy in just 5 weeks of training my lats and shoulders are getting particularly big 

ampx200b

i wouldnt completely discard the gym but i will do what a lot of calesthetics guys do go to the gym only for leg training and use body weight for upper body"
"im an endurance athlete and have a love hate with gyms but the variety of equipment i dont have to maintain keeps me going there

why is the endurance athlete thing relevant ever run ride or anything for 2 hours while staring at a wall yeah i hate gyms with a passion but

a i live in a part of the world it gets cold and i like it hot

b jacobs ladders and ellipticalstreadmills that can handle my work load are expensive so are free weights

c you meet like minded people at the gym"
"i was born a human"
"unethical membership model can you explain"
"some such as 24 hour fitness dont let you cancel in person  you have to call in to a special call center where they hassle you to keep your membership  this particular gym actually closed their call center during this corona virus pandemic and has continued to bill customers even though they cannot access the gym"
"fair points another paradox of the human race"
