<h1>15: <em><span style="color: #D0D0D0">.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented">The real showerthought is in the comments</p>
<h1>17: <em><span style="color: #D0D0D0">.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Its closer to  percent.</p>
<h1>18: <em><span style="color: green">+.102</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Honestly, I got a membership to AAA in February thinking I had a big road trip in April.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Now my car is sitting in the driveway like a lawn ornament...</mark></p>
<h1>23: <em><span style="color: green">+.155</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">One time i killed my battery sitting in my car during my lunch break.</mark> <mark class = "pos">About a half hour and $ later i had a new battery.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Thanks AAA</mark></p>
<h1>26: <em><span style="color: green">+.109</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I thought about that, but since I have AAA, I'm not worried about it!!</mark> But seriously, I'm driving around the neighborhood at least once a week to keep it charged.</p>
<h1>27: <em><span style="color: green">+.206</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">My gym isn't charging during the pandemic.</mark> That and they're closed too.</p>
<h1>30: <em><span style="color: red">-.011</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">My gym was closed for two weeks, and after that I got an email asking how to handle the payments they received.</mark> <mark class = "neg">There were a choice of deducting it from the next fee, or to not claim it at all.</mark> I thought about all the people that would probably get affected by this in the long run, and opted to not ask for anything back. <mark class = "neg">Now, it opened again after those two weeks, but they're probably taking quite a hit economically, and I'm just hoping they can keep all the employees.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I'm not going there, but still paying, since I also care about not being part of spreading corona if I can avoid it.</mark></p>
<h1>39: <em><span style="color: red">-.173</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I don't remember exactly when our gym shut down here.</mark> I think it was sometime in March.</p>
<h1>45: <em><span style="color: green">+.295</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Same, made some good progress after going back to the gym after like  years then this shit happens</mark></p>
<h1>50: <em><span style="color: green">+.202</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Ha, same! <mark class = "pos">Finally found a gym I feel really comfortable in.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Well it's not going anywhere, hopefully, so I will just start going again when it's safe.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I had to get swabbed today for covid as I have a sore throat and a cough, so it's at least  days of isolation for me till the test comes back.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Neither dr I talked to thinks its it though, no cases near us at all, but better safe than sorry.</mark> Still, common sense doesn't seem so common these days so I will hibernate as long as I can. <mark class = "pos">Hello from BC Canada, stay safe over there.</mark></p>
<h1>53: <em><span style="color: green">+.306</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Hope it's not covid, or atleast that it won't give you or others close to you a difficult time. <mark class = "pos">Wish you all the best and a quick recovery!</mark> I also find that the common sense becomes less common as time pass. <mark class = "pos">I guess it's our best survival "talent", adaptation, that's not beneficial right now.</mark></p>
<h1>55: <em><span style="color: #D0D0D0">.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Same.</p>
<h1>60: <em><span style="color: red">-.112</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Oof this hits too hard</mark></p>
<h1>70: <em><span style="color: red">-.020</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">More like it's a bad year to be a gym.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Can always work out at home.</mark></p>
<h1>77: <em><span style="color: green">+.250</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Good points.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Though I will say my husband is getting a more vigorous workout doing jump rope and body weight exercises than he was getting at the gym.</mark> Only investment so far has been a pipe so he can do pull-ups.</p>
<h1>95: <em><span style="color: #D0D0D0">.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I've been going as often as other years.</p>
<h1>96: <em><span style="color: green">+.169</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Girlfriend: We need to get a gym membership. Me: Nope. <mark class = "pos">Who's laughing now???</mark></p>
<h1>104: <em><span style="color: green">+.478</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">My gym still charges monthly but they'll give us free months to balance.</mark></p>
<h1>108: <em><span style="color: green">+.012</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">And my Regal Unlimited membership, also paid for the whole year up front.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I haven't received any communications from Regal Theaters regarding whether there will be some kind of give back, but I wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Theaters are struggling so much, and this was from before the coronavirus shutdowns.</mark> .</p>
<h1>112: <em><span style="color: green">+.183</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Planet Fitness suspended all payments from customers. <mark class = "pos">Im thankful for that but i read that the ahutdown is gonna take a whole % out of their total savings.</mark></p>
<h1>118: <em><span style="color: #D0D0D0">.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented">And an eharmony account lol. Unless you count penpals.</p>
<h1>121: <em><span style="color: green">+.326</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I was planning on getting a membership the Friday but didn't - cause of laziness!</mark> The Monday they closed the gyms. I'm taking it as a sign....</p>
<h1>124: <em><span style="color: green">+.250</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Let's be honest here, it doesn't make a difference</mark></p>
<h1>125: <em><span style="color: #D0D0D0">.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Mine paused payments</p>
<h1>127: <em><span style="color: green">+.075</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I was going to join up just as the lockdown happened.</mark></p>
<h1>130: <em><span style="color: green">+.195</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I use a local YMCA and they've offered to suspend your account, have you pay half to support their overhead, or pay the monthly as a donation.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm extremely fortunate to not be financially impacted by this, and donating to support my local community is exactly where I want my money to go.</mark></p>
<h1>133: <em><span style="color: green">+.008</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I joined one at the start of February.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Was going - times a week and was actually feeling better and starting to see little physical difference.</mark> Got the notice / they were shutting down so I got weights and stuff for the garage. <mark class = "neg">Problem is that's where the beer and weed is too so my workouts seem get interrupted</mark></p>
<h1>134: <em><span style="color: #D0D0D0">.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented">&gt; was

Is</p>
<h1>135: <em><span style="color: #D0D0D0">.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented">lol how</p>
<h1>9: <em><span style="color: green">+.087</span></em></h1><p class="indented">lol me too! <mark class = "pos">Its honestly the only reason i can motivate myself to go to the gym.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I just think about how good it feels to sit in there after and it drives me to go.</mark></p>
<h1>15: <em><span style="color: red">-.265</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I doubt they are cutting their own hair</mark></p>
<h1>17: <em><span style="color: green">+.146</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Ditto all of this. I maintain a small home gym in my unused second bedroom (mostly unused, if you count boxes from my last move I never unpacked). <mark class = "pos">It's by far the best non-car money I've spent in the last few years.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I don't care for the whole process of going to the gym, so this has been fantastic.</mark> <mark class = "pos">So much time and energy saved by having it at home!</mark></p>
<h1>18: <em><span style="color: green">+.283</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Same as well.</mark> I have a very small space but I have a rack and weights and its replaced the gym for me. <mark class = "pos">I know its not for everyone, but it has enhanced my life so much just doing it at my home on my own schedule in my own space.</mark></p>
<h1>23: <em><span style="color: green">+.038</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Is that something that can be solved with a space heater and standalone AC?</mark> <mark class = "neg">My gym is in my second bedroom so heating isn't so much an issue but it gets gnarly hot in summer thanks to the location of my AC and the poor airflow/design of my apartment.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Can definitely relate thereeven though putting in a vertical fan helped my summer workouts are definitely sweaty and dehydrating.</mark></p>
<h1>26: <em><span style="color: green">+.059</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Not knocking it at all but you can insulate the garage for a couple hundred pretty easy and a decent space heater on a smart switch or two are cheap.</mark> Window hvac is a Hundred. I say this having just done it. <mark class = "neg">I didn't do it for a gym, but to work on other shit.</mark> <mark class = "pos">But it's doable, I just prefer the gym myself.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Just food for thought.</mark></p>
<h1>27: <em><span style="color: green">+.174</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I would definitely be interested in attempted it.</mark> Where do you live?</p>
<h1>30: <em><span style="color: green">+.102</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">This - I mostly do functional fitness stuff, usually a class  -  days and train myself on the alternates and I really miss it because it was my time out from the world.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I've always been fun training at home, running, doing Nike Training Clubs or using a WOD Generator if I want to do a bit of crossfit style stuff...</mark> but the gym is my control. <mark class = "pos">I go before work and it's the time when I can say 'I didn't just wake up to work'.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Plus, I just really enjoy the classes.</mark></p>
<h1>39: <em><span style="color: green">+.189</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Body weight has been my best choice and I'm shredded.</mark> I'm not affected by the lockdown. <mark class = "pos">I'm even helping people stay active with body weight.</mark></p>
<h1>45: <em><span style="color: #D0D0D0">.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Can I ask what HIIT routine are you currently doing?</p>
<h1>50: <em><span style="color: red">-.204</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I'm too scared to even try!</mark></p>
<h1>53: <em><span style="color: green">+.211</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Fitness is the practice of adapting to the physical demands placed on the body.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The majority of people do very little to change up their routine, and thus they experience diminishing returns.</mark> <mark class = "pos">After all, if you routine is always about the same, what is there for the body to adapt to?</mark> <mark class = "pos">What we are experiencing now, as a global community, is a forced change to our fitness routine, so I am not surprised you are having good results; however, the science shows that you will adapt to your new routine between  and  weeks of starting it.</mark> <mark class = "pos">So although there is plenty of variation that can be introduced even with a home workout, I wouldn't cancel my gym membership.</mark> <mark class = "pos">When you go back to weights you'll have an even more effective workout than before.</mark></p>
<h1>55: <em><span style="color: green">+.229</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I've been working out in my home consistently for about  years now.</mark> <mark class = "pos">During this time I have added to my equipment as my interests grew and I looked for new ways to motivate myself.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The best thing about what is happening now from a fitness standpoint is that people are discovering new ways of working out.</mark> Changing their routine. <mark class = "neg">Suddenly things like resistance bands, body weight training, jump ropes etc are found to be very challenging and beneficial.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I hope people remember this when things get back to normal.</mark> I wouldn't think of ever going to a gym. <mark class = "pos">And always looking for some new equipment.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Good luck to all of you.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I would add that I am fortunate to have a basement to do this.</mark> <mark class = "pos">So no disrespect to anyone that does not or just prefers the gym environment.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Just remember that variety really can hold your interest in those times when we all need that extra push.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Don't let this time go to waste.</mark></p>
<h1>60: <em><span style="color: #D0D0D0">.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Oh God same here!!!!!!</p>
<h1>70: <em><span style="color: green">+.578</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">No problem!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Hope you enjoy it.</mark></p>
<h1>77: <em><span style="color: green">+.134</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Same here. <mark class = "pos">I spend nearly  a month on gyms but now I feel like I get more out of going to the park.</mark></p>
<h1>95: <em><span style="color: red">-.497</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I'm not. <mark class = "neg">I hate bodyweight stuff.</mark> <mark class = "neg">It sucks and it's boring.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I want a goddamn barbell in my hands.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Fuck.</mark></p>
<h1>96: <em><span style="color: red">-.002</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I feel the same way. I don't even have a pull up bar. <mark class = "neg">I've a suspension system, a bar that i set between two chairs to do Australian pull ups, the wall and the floor.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Between doing push ups, rows, and using the suspension system to do assisted vertical pushes I've developed MUSCLE and I've began to hypertrophy in just  weeks of training.</mark> <mark class = "pos">My lats and shoulders are getting particularly big.</mark> <mark class = "pos">&amp;#xB;

I wouldn't completely discard the gym, but I will do what a lot of calesthetics guys do: go to the gym only for leg training and use body weight for upper body.</mark></p>
